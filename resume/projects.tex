    %Electric current method was shown to be useful for long range analog underwater communication. This project shows that it is capable of delivering much higher bit rate digital information for short range compared to that of acoustic method.%Electric current method was shown to be useful for long range analog underwater communication. This project shows that it is capable of delivering much higher bit rate digital information for short range compared to that of acoustic method. Methods to enhance the underwater communication range by focusing electric current into the desired direction are also presented.
